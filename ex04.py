# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input('Pls input a number:'))
print("Your number's divisors is:")
for i in range(2, number): # this can be optimized with sqrt(number)
    if number % i == 0:
        print (i)
