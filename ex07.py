# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = a[1::2]
print(b)

c = [n for n in a if n % 2 == 0]
print(c)
