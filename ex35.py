# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

# Your program should output something like:

# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
# }

import json
import datetime

with open("birthday.json", "r") as fh:
    birthdays = json.load(fh)
    monthes =[]
    for name in birthdays :
        day = datetime.datetime.strptime( birthdays[name], "%m/%d/%Y")
        monthes.append( day.strftime("%B"))
    
    from collections import Counter
    monthes= Counter(monthes)
    monthes= dict(monthes)
    print(monthes)
